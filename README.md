# Robotica-Matlab

This repository contains several robotics projects in Matlab, which simulate the trajectory of a two- and three-link robotic arm. Some important points are:
- The mathematical calculations can be found in a pdf inside each folder, where the kinematic and dynamic model of the robotic arm is explained, as well as the motion and control equations.
- Illustrative videos show how the robotic arm works in different scenarios, such as following a trajectory
- The source code is written in Matlab and can be executed from the main.m file, which calls the helper functions and simulation scripts.
- The parameters of the robotic arm, such as the length and the mass of the links, can be modified in the file parameters.m, which also defines the initial and final conditions of the trajectory.
- The results of the simulation can be displayed in different graphs, which show the position, speed, acceleration and torque of each joint of the robotic arm, as well as the error between the desired trajectory and the real one.
